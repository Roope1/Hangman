# Hangman

First java project in a long while, so the code isn't the cleanest I've ever written, but it gets the job done.
Also experimented and learned how pull requests work in this project, thus the possibly unneccessary pull requests.


Simple console based hangman game that takes a word from a txt.file randomly and forces the player to guess the word, you know how hangman works.
